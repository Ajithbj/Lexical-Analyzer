# Lexical-Analyzer

The scanning/lexical analysis phase of a compiler performs the task of reading the 
source program as a file of characters divided up into tokens.

Usually implemented as a subroutine or co-routine of the parser.

The front end of a compiler.

The tokens:-Each token is a sequence of characters that represents a unit of information in 
the source program.

A compilation process is a sequence of various phases. Each phase takes input from 
its previous stage has its own representation of the source program and its output to 
the next phase of the compiler

 Problem Statement:
 
Design a lexical analyzer for a given language and the lexical analyzer should ignore 
redundant spaces, tabs, and new lines. It should also ignore comments. Although the syntax 
specification states that identifiers can be arbitrarily long, you may restrict the length to 
some reasonable value.
